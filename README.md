This demo illustrates the Confused Deputy Problem for AI agents.

## How to Run

**1. Install dependencies:**

```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Run Streamlit:**

        streamlit run app.py


**3. Enter a user prompt in the Streamlit UI.**

Demo Concept

- User intent is explicitly defined.
- AI agent has broad system access (ambient authority).
- Agent can act beyond user-intended scope.
- No IAM exploits or cloud services required.

----> This demonstrates Ambient Authority Confusion.
